## DML Trigger

- A `DML trigger` is a trigger that is automatically fired (executed) whenever an SQL `DML` statement (INSERT,
  UPDATE, or DELETE) is executed.

- You classify DML triggers in two ways:
  - By **when** they execute: 
    - BEFORE, AFTER, or INSTEAD OF the triggering DML statement.
  - By **how many times** they execute: 
    - Once for the whole DML statement (a statement trigger), or once for each row affected by the DML statement (a row trigger).
