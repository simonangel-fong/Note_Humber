## Booleans

The `Boolean` type can be viewed as **numeric** in nature because its values (`True` and `False`) are just customized versions of the integers `1` and `0`.

The `True` and `False` behave in the same way as `1` and `0`, they just make the code more readable.

- Example:

```py

print("\n--------Demo for Boolean--------\n")

boolean_var = True

print(boolean_var)
print(boolean_var*5)  # boolean true is the way of 1

```
