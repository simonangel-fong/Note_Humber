## What is Data?

- Data can be many things:
- Not all data can be used as-is.
- Data Analysis provides useful information and **trends**.

- **Functions:**
  - Data Science
  - Data Engineering
  - Data Analytics
  - Business Intelligence

These four functions work together to generate <u>business value</u> from data.

## Data Science

`Data science` is the systematic study of the **structure and behavior of data** in order to understand past and current occurrences, as well as <u>predict the future behavior</u> of that data.

- Data scientist

  - Typical Traits

    - Degree in quantitative field
    - Programmer
    - Curious personalities
    - Previous experience

  - Tasks

    - Data scientists **derive insights from data**, including big data (data from data engineered system)
    - Uncover **correlations in business data** to support <u>business decision making</u>.
    - These people **generate predictions** from data and communicate predictions through data visualization.

  - Requirement
    - STEM Degree, with advanced math
    - Coding: Python, R, SQL, Spark, machine learning

## Data Engineer

- `Data Engineer`:the **design, construction and maintenance** of <u>data systems</u>.
  - Programmers
    - Good in math, but donâ€™t use statistic much
    - Previous experience: database architect, database developer
    - Prefer to <u>design and built IT systems</u> rather than to analyze data
    - Data engineers design system to collect, handle, and store big datasets
    - Data engineers build modular, scalable platforms for data processing

## Data Analytics

- `Data analytics` are **data products** that **describe** data and how it behaves. These data products are generated from data analysis and visualization processes.

- Typical Traits
  - Use applications to analyze data
  - Solid in basic math
  - Understand the inner working of the business very well.
  - Enjoy using data insights to improve business
  - Deploys analytics technologies: analytics software application

---

## Data Analysis

- Data analysis is a process of **making sense of data**
- Data analysis could include _data cleaning_, _reformatting_, and _recombining data_
- Discovering _trends_, _patterns_ and _findings_ in data that describe real-life phenomenon.

---

## Data Science

`Data science` is the systematic study of the **structure and behavior of data** in order to quantifiably understand past and current occurrences, as well as predict the future behavior of that data.

---

## Artificial Intelligence

A machine or application with the **capacity to autonomously execute upon predictions** it makes from data

- `Artificial`: Made by human skill
- `Intelligence`: The capacity to learn and solve problems
`Artificial Intelligence`: Artificial Intelligence(AI) is the <u>simulation of human intelligence</u> by machines.
   - The ability to solve problem
   - The ability to act rationally
    - The ability to acts like humans



---

## Deep learning

- `Deep learning` is a set of **predictive methodologies** that borrows its structure from neural network structure of the brain.
  - This class of methods is particularly **effective for making predictions from big data**.
- `Deep learning` is a **sub field** from data science, and it can be used as a **decision model** with applications to produce deep learning AI.
