## XML

- `Extensible Markup Language (XML)` is a **markup language** that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both humanreadable and machine-readable.

- `XML` **isnâ€™t a language**; its rules are used to <u>construct other languages</u>
- `XML` is based on W3C Standard
