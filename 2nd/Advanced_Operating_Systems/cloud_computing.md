## What is cloud computing?

- `Cloud Computing`: the <u>delivery of computing services</u>—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet ("the cloud")

---

## Top benefits of cloud computing

- **Cost**
  Cloud computing eliminates the capital expense of buying hardware and software and setting up and running on-site datacenters—the racks of servers, the round-the-clock electricity for power and cooling, and the IT experts for managing the infrastructure. It adds up fast.

- **Speed**
  Most cloud computing services are provided self service and on demand, so even vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes, typically with just a few mouse clicks, giving businesses a lot of flexibility and taking the pressure off capacity planning.

- **Global scale**
  The benefits of cloud computing services include the ability to scale elastically. In cloud speak, that means delivering the right amount of IT resources—for example, more or less computing power, storage, bandwidth—right when they’re needed, and from the right geographic location.

- **Productivity**
  On-site datacenters typically require a lot of “racking and stacking”—hardware setup, software patching, and other time-consuming IT management chores. Cloud computing removes the need for many of these tasks, so IT teams can spend time on achieving more important business goals.

- **Performance**
  The biggest cloud computing services run on a worldwide network of secure datacenters, which are regularly upgraded to the latest generation of fast and efficient computing hardware. This offers several benefits over a single corporate datacenter, including reduced network latency for applications and greater economies of scale.

- **Reliability**
  Cloud computing makes data backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity easier and less expensive because data can be mirrored at multiple redundant sites on the cloud provider’s network.

- **Security**
  Many cloud providers offer a broad set of policies, technologies, and controls that strengthen your security posture overall, helping protect your data, apps, and infrastructure from potential threats.

## Types of cloud computing

- **Public cloud**

  - Public clouds are owned and **operated by a third-party cloud** service providers, which deliver their computing resources, like servers and storage, over the Internet.
  - With a public cloud, all hardware, software, and other supporting infrastructure is owned and managed by the cloud provider.
  - You access these services and manage your account using a web browser.
  - `Microsoft Azure` is an example of a public cloud.

- **Private cloud**

  - A private cloud refers to cloud computing resources **used exclusively by a single business or organization**. A private cloud can be physically located on the company’s on-site datacenter. Some companies also pay third-party service providers to host their private cloud. A private cloud is one in which the services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network.

- **Hybrid cloud**
  - Hybrid clouds combine public and private clouds, bound together by technology that allows data and applications to be shared between them. By allowing data and applications to move between private and public clouds, a hybrid cloud gives your business greater flexibility, more deployment options, and helps optimize your existing infrastructure, security, and compliance.

## Types of cloud services: IaaS, PaaS, serverless, and SaaS

- **Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)**

  - `IAAS: infrastructure as a service`
  - The most basic category of cloud computing services. With `IaaS`, you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.

- **Platform as a service (PaaS)**

  - `PaaS: platform as a service`
  - Platform as a service refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering, and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it **easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps**, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network, and databases needed for development.

- **Serverless computing**

  - Overlapping with PaaS, serverless computing **focuses on building app functionality** without spending time continually managing the servers and infrastructure required to do so. The cloud provider handles the setup, capacity planning, and server management for you. Serverless architectures are highly scalable and event-driven, only using resources when a specific function or trigger occurs.

- **Software as a service (SaaS)**
  - `Saas:software as a service`
  - `Software as a service` is a method for **delivering software applications** over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure, and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. Users connect to the application over the Internet, usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet, or PC.

## Uses of cloud computing

- Here are a few **examples** of what’s possible today with **cloud services** from a cloud provider:

  - **Create cloud-native applications**
    Quickly build, deploy, and scale applications—web, mobile, and API. Take advantage of cloud-native technologies and approaches, such as containers, Kubernetes, microservices architecture, API-driven communication, and DevOps.

  - **Test and build applications**
    Reduce application development cost and time by using cloud infrastructures that can easily be scaled up or down.

  - **Store, back up, and recover data**
    Protect your data more cost-efficiently—and at massive scale—by transferring your data over the Internet to an offsite cloud storage system that’s accessible from any location and any device.

  - **Analyze data**
    Unify your data across teams, divisions, and locations in the cloud. Then use cloud services, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence, to uncover insights for more informed decisions.

  - **Stream audio and video**
    Connect with your audience anywhere, anytime, on any device with high-definition video and audio with global distribution.

  - **Embed intelligence**
    Use intelligent models to help engage customers and provide valuable insights from the data captured.

  - **Deliver software on demand**
    Also known as software as a service (SaaS), on-demand software lets you offer the latest software versions and updates around to customers—anytime they need, anywhere they are.

## 术语

- `SaaS (Software as a Service)`

  - SaaS (Software as a Service) <u>providers</u> sell **access to application software and databases**.
  - SaaS <u>customers</u> are **end users** who typically access the software **through a web browser or client program**.
  - SaaS <u>customers</u> **don’t see the underlying infrastructure or platform** it’s built on, because SaaS providers take care of all the necessary hardware and coding.

  - Example:
    - Gmail
    - Microsoft Office 365
    - Client relationship management systems, or CRMs

- `IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)`

  - IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) <u>providers</u> sell **access to virtualized resources, including servers, networks, and storage**.
  - Enterprise customers typically purchase these compute resources as needed, which is more cost-effective than buying hardware outright.
  - IaaS <u>customers</u> must **manage the applications, runtime, middleware, operating systems, and data they access**.
  - The IaaS <u>providers</u>, meanwhile, **manage the servers, hard drives, networking, virtualization, and storage**.

  - Example:
    - Amazon Web Services
    - Microsoft Azure
    - and Google Compute Engine

- `PaaS (Platform as a Service)`

  - PaaS (Platform as a Service) <u>providers</u> sell **access to everything a customer would need to develop an app**.
  - PaaS <u>providers</u> **manage runtime, middleware, and operating systems**.
  - PaaS <u>customers</u> still get to **manage data and applications**—in contrast to the SaaS model, where customers don’t have to manage anything.
  - So in terms of the cloud continuum, PaaS fits snugly between IaaS and SaaS.
  - PaaS enables customers **to develop, test, and launch an app** without having to maintain the necessary software or invest in any new infrastructure.
  - <u>Software developers</u> use cloud PaaS technology to basically “rent” all of the tools they need **to build an app**.

  - Example:
    - AWS Elastic Beanstalk
    - Google App Engine
    - Adobe Commerce
